# marineAI

`marineAI` is a PyTorch-based computer vision project that uses transfer learning (ResNet) to classify seabed images into **shipwreck** (archaeological site) or **no_shipwreck**. This repository includes:

- A **utility module** (`marineAI_utils.py`) for data loading and model training.  
- A **main training script** (`train_marineAI.py`) to fine-tune a ResNet architecture and save the trained model.  
- A **classification script** (`classify_new_image.py`) to load the saved model and predict on new images.

## Project Overview

**marineAI** aims to help marine archaeologists automatically identify potential shipwrecks in seabed imagery. By leveraging a pretrained ResNet (transfer learning on ImageNet weights), we reduce training time and improve performance for our specific binary classification task.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/marineAI.git
   cd marineAI
Install dependencies (ideally within a virtual environment):
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install torch torchvision pillow
If you have a GPU, also install the appropriate CUDA drivers and a compatible version of PyTorch.
Data Preparation
Organize your dataset into the following directory structure:

kotlin
Copy
Edit
data/
├── train/
│   ├── shipwreck/
│   └── no_shipwreck/
└── val/
    ├── shipwreck/
    └── no_shipwreck/
train/shipwreck: Contains training images that are labeled as shipwreck.
train/no_shipwreck: Contains training images that are labeled as no_shipwreck.
val/shipwreck: Contains validation images that are labeled as shipwreck.
val/no_shipwreck: Contains validation images that are labeled as no_shipwreck.
Update train_dir and val_dir in train_marineAI.py if you place your data elsewhere.

Training the Model
Once the data is prepared:

bash
Copy
Edit
python train_marineAI.py
This will:

Instantiate a ResNet-18 model with pretrained ImageNet weights.
Freeze (by default) all layers except the final classification layer (which is replaced to match your number of classes).
Train the model for a specified number of epochs on your seabed dataset.
Evaluate on the validation set each epoch.
Save the trained model weights to marineAI_resnet.pth.
You can adjust training parameters in train_marineAI.py:

batch_size, learning_rate, epochs, freeze_backbone (whether to unfreeze and fine-tune all layers).
Classifying New Images
Use the classify_new_image.py script to load the saved model and predict on new images:

Open classify_new_image.py.
Set:
test_image_path to the image you want to classify.
trained_model_path to the path of the saved weights (default is marineAI_resnet.pth).
class_names array (e.g., ["no_shipwreck", "shipwreck"]) in the order that matches your training set.
Run:
bash
Copy
Edit
python classify_new_image.py
The script will print out the predicted label for your input image.

marineAI_utils.py

get_data_loaders(...): Creates PyTorch DataLoaders for training and validation data.
Trainer class: Houses the model, optimizer, and training/evaluation loops.
train_marineAI.py

Loads data via get_data_loaders().
Instantiates the Trainer class.
Trains and validates the model.
Saves the final model weights.
classify_new_image.py

Demonstrates how to load and use the trained model for inference on any new image.
Customization
Model Architecture: Feel free to replace models.resnet18 with other options like resnet50, resnet101, or any torchvision.models variant.
Data Augmentations: Modify transforms (e.g., RandomRotation, ColorJitter) in marineAI_utils.py.
Freeze or Unfreeze: Toggle freeze_backbone=True/False in the Trainer to control whether pretrained layers are trainable.
Hyperparameters: Adjust learning_rate, epochs, or batch_size in train_marineAI.py to suit your data size and hardware.
Thank you for checking out marineAI!
Contributions, questions, and suggestions are welcome.

Happy training and seabed exploring!
